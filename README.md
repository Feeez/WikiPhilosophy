# WikiPhilosophy
A short Proof of Concept of the Philosophy of Wikipedia

# Description
A short python script to visualize links between Wikipedia articles in Gephi. The script runs alone and outputs 2 files : nodes.csv (contains node's ID and NAME) and edges.csv (contains ID, SOURCE and TARGET).

# Installation
You'll need python 3.x and Gephi to run the script.

Download Gephi [here](https://gephi.org/users/download/).

# Run
```bash
$> python main.py
How much articles to crawl ? 20
...
```

Once the python script has ended, import the nodes.csv and then edges.csv in Gephi. There you go !
